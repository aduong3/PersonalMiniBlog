# aduong3.github.io

I followed along a To-Do List CRUD tutorial on YouTube and decided that I wanted to spin it off into a Mini Blog page.
It is a small project so things are saved into the localStorage.
This project was for experimenting with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The data is saved onto the localStorage so it won't be able to store a lot.

For some reason, it would not work on Github Pages.
